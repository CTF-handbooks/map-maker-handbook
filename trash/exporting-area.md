### 1. Exporting your area (optional and experimental)
With generated terrain, it might be hard to add the barriers with terrain blocking your view. This method can remove the extra terrain around your map.
> If you are building the barriers before building your map, this method might make it hard to expand your map later on. A more time-consuming alternative to this method will be mentioned.
* Run the following command in chat:
  ```
  /ctf_map e
  ```
* Click `Create New Map`.

* Next, select the area that your map will be in by either punching the nodes on the two opposite corners (similar to selecting an area with WorldEdit as mentioned above) or running the following command while standing at each corner:
  ```
  /ctf_map here
  ```
* After that, run `ctf_map e` again, scroll all the way down (ignore the fields and options), and click `finish editing`.

* Go to `<Minetest folder>/worlds/<your world name>/schems` and copy the folder `new_map`.
