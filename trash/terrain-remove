### 1. Barriers
* Placing barriers could be a bit confusing with generated terrains since the terrain might be blocking your view.
* This is optional, but you can select some of the terrain outside the area of your map with WorldEdit (make sure to not select anything within the area you want to build your map in!) and replace them with air by running the following command in chat:
  ```
  //s air
  ```
* Do the same for all four sides (and bottom) of the map and eventually, your map will be isolated from the terrain around it.
