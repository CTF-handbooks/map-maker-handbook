# Building the Map and Barriers for `v7` or `flat`

It is your choice to build the barriers first or the map first. For this example we are going to build the barriers first.
***
### 1. Barriers
* Placing barriers could be a bit confusing with generated terrains since the terrain might be blocking your view.
* This is optional, but you can select some of the terrain outside the area of your map with WorldEdit (make sure to not select anything within the area you want to build your map in!) and replace them with air by running the following command in chat:
  ```
  //s air
  ```
* Do the same for all four sides (and bottom) of the map and eventually, your map will be isolated from the terrain around it.

### 5. Building the map
* Find a place to build your map and start building it. You can add any structure you want. Many blocks have indestructible variants, which you can use for builds you don't want players to destroy (use the admin pickaxe to break indestructible blocks).

* You should also add the following:
    * Indestructible blocks under the position of the flag (the flag will be added later). The minimum surface area for this indestructible platform is `5x5` blocks (the flag should be in the middle).
    * Team chests for each team. You can find them as a node in the inventory.

    * _Optional_: ores (such as iron, diamond, or mese ores). The amount of ores for each team should be about the same to ensure that no team has an advantage (please note that mapgens such as v7 and flat come with ores).
