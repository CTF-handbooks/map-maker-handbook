# The Map Maker's Handbook

This is a detailed guide on how to create a map for the Minetest Capture the Flag game.

### 1. Required Tools
* Minetest version 5.6 or above.
    > If you don't have Minetest installed, you can download it from the [official Minetest website](https://www.minetest.net/).
* Capture the Flag game for Minetest.
    > You can install the game from either the Minetest in-game ContentDB or from the [ContentDB website](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rubenwardy/capturetheflag/).
    
    > Once you downloaded the .zip file from the ContentDB website, extract the .zip file and move the folder inside it to `[Minetest folder]/games`.
* WorldEdit mod for Minetest (_optional_).
    > Although this is optional, it is recommended that you install WorldEdit. Creating maps requires you to build the borders and barriers of the map manually. This tool speeds the process up. This is also helpful when building other map structures.

    > You can install WorldEdit from either the Minetest in-game ContentDB or from the [ContentDB website](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sfan5/worldedit/).

    > Once you downloaded the .zip file from the ContentDB website, extract the .zip file and move the folder inside it to `[Minetest folder]/mods`.

### 2. Planning the map
* A map shouldn't be too big or too small. The size of a map can vary depending on the terrain and structures that the map will have. A maximum of *230 x 230x* blocks in surface area is recommended.
* If you are making a map for the official CTF server, it is important to note that your map should be unique and not similar to the maps that already exist in the game.
